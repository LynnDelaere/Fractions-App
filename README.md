# Fractions App

## Project description

In the whole solution you can find a console application, "FractionsConsoleApp", a library "FractionsLibrary", a unit test "FractionsUnitTest" and a WPF application "FractionsWPFApp".

This section provides a short explanation about every part in the solution.

### Console App

The console application utilizes the custom library called "FractionsLibrary" to function as a fraction calculator. The application asks the user to input the numerator and denominator of two fractions, which are validated to ensure the input is a valid integer and that the denominators are not zero.
Upon valid inputs, the application creates two fraction objects based on the user's input.
The application preforms arithmetic operations on the two fractions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on these fractions. Additionally, it computes the reciprocal, where the numerator and denominator are swapped, and the invert of the first fraction. The application also provides a floating-point approximation of the two fractions.
The applications ensures input validity by employing two methodes that continuously prompt the user for input until valid values are provided, preventing the program from crashing due to invalid input.
